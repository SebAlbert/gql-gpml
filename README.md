# GQL and GPML

This repository is an attempt to implement the Graph Query Language (GQL)
and especially its Graph Pattern Matching Language (GPML) part from scratch.

Disclaimer:
The undertaking is, for the time being, purely recreational and self-teaching.
The goal may never be accomplished.

GQL is a forthcoming standard (think SQL for Graphs), and its GPML has been
preliminarily described in a very illustrative paper that can be found here:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06217v1.pdf

This has nothing to do with GraphQL nor with Machine Learning,
which tend to be found under the same acronyms.

It is, however, akin to things like Graph Databases, Cypher, G-CORE or PGQL.
